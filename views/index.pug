    | Hi, I'm Ian, a Computer Science student at Penn State Harrisburg. I've 
    | created this site to share my opinions, experiences, and personal
    | projects. I also just like the idea of publishing to the web, and web 
    | development has long been an interest of mine, so this site itself is an
    | exercise/project all its own. If you're interested in hiring me, take a
    | look around, and be sure to check out my 
    | #[a(href='https://github.com/ns-ian') GitHub page] for samples of my code.
    | Thanks!
